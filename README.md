# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the code samples, exercises and tests written during the Data Structures and Algorithms course in Java by Tim Buchalka on Udemy.

## What is a Data Structure

_A data structure serves as a storage medium for data. Where and how data is stored can be reffered to as a **data structure**. Examples are: **arrays, trees, stacks, lists e.t.c.** Usually, different data structures serve different purposes and/or work better in certain conditions when compared to others as would be seen during the entirety of this course_

A quote by Linus Torvalds goes thus:

> The fact is, there aren't just two sides to any issue, there is almost always a range of
> responses. And, "it depends" is almost always the right answer to any big issue

## What is an Algorithm

_An algorithm is a step-by-step process to solving a problem or accomplishing a task_

Example:

_My algorithm to solving an actual problem_

1. Write the problem down
2. Read it over and over again to make sure what is required is understood
3. Jot down a possible solution
4. Review efficiency metrics
5. Find optimization strategies
6. Implement
7. Rinse
8. Repeat

## Introduction to Arrays

_Arrays are data structures that stores data in contiguous memory locations and the data is accessed using indexes. Arrays work fine in providing access to data via indexes, but when the index isn't known really tedious._

## Big-O Notation

_When running algorithms, two things are of major concern: time and space/memory. These days, memory is considered to be cheap and it's contribution to the calculation of an algorithm's efficiency isn't really factored._

_On the other hand, time complexity refers to the relationship that exists between the amount of input parameters and the amount of steps that are executed in order to complete the algorithm and how that affects the total time spent._


_Usually represented as O(<time_complexity>) - pronounced as "O of TC". The most common ones are O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(nlog n), O(n<sup>2</sup>)_

| Time Complexity | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| O(1)      | Constant Time       |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic Time        |
| O(n)   | Linear Time        |
| O(nlog n)   | Logarithmic Time        |
| O(n<sup>2</sup>)   | Quadratic Time        |
