This repository contains the code samples, exercises and tests written during the Data Structures and Algorithms course in Java by Tim Buchalka on Udemy.

## What is a Data Structure

_A data structure serves as a storage medium for data. Where and how data is stored can be reffered to as a **data structure**. Examples are: **arrays, trees, stacks, lists e.t.c.** Usually, different data structures serve different purposes and/or work better in certain conditions when compared to others as would be seen during the entirety of this course_

A quote by Linus Torvalds goes thus:

> The fact is, there aren't just two sides to any issue, there is almost always a range of
> responses. And, "it depends" is almost always the right answer to any big issue

## What is an Algorithm

_An algorithm is a step-by-step process to solving a problem or accomplishing a task_

Example:

_My algorithm to solving an actual problem_

1. Write the problem down
2. Read it over and over again to make sure what is required is understood
3. Jot down a possible solution
4. Review efficiency metrics
5. Find optimization strategies
6. Implement
7. Rinse
8. Repeat
